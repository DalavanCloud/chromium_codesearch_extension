chromium_codesearch_extension
=============================

Small Chrome extension for searching in Chromium Codesearch.

Works like selecting a word, right clicking and selecting the entry "Chromium CodeSearch 'bla'".

To load as a non-compiled extension, just load the folder in chrome://extensions via "Load unpacked extension".

To recompile click on "Pack Extension" from chrome://extensions, providing the .pem file for it. (I think the PEM shouldn't be in the folder to compile).
